# hello-world
my first repository
my name is emma schwarzrock and I'm learning how to use Git-Hub. I play violin and compete in CyberPatriot and DECA competitions. I have also learned that it's fun using a Linux OS. I tried to change my uid to 0 in hopes of becoming the most powerful superuser ever and ruling over my Chromebook for all eternity. Unfortunately, I broke it and had to redownload the Linux environment.
